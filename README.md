## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles

### What I learned

It was the first project I tried using ‘tailwind’ and I learnt it quite well, making the media queries was more difficult, but I managed well

If you want more help with tailwind css, we'd recommend checking out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills in the prototype mechanics of react, it's been very useful, and above all I want to start thinking faster.
